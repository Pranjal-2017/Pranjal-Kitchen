Welcome to Pranjal's Kitchen!
I have made this Food recipe website to help every person to get ingredients of every kind of different recipes. 
You just need to search for the main ingredient name and you can get different dishes made from that ingredient.
I have made this website using ReactJs and Bootstrap.
I tried to make the website very easy so that everyone can access it and take the advantage of my website.

To run around the website locally, please follow the steps below:

Clone the repository
Go into the directory where the package.json resides
Install dependencies: only axios package needs to be installed.(You can do it by typing npm i axios) in the terminal.

To run the code:
write: npm start to start the website in the local host.

Then can search the main ingredient and get the recipes of delicious items.
The default ingredient is being given as soup. (As it is the appetizer).
